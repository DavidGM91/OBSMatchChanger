# OBSMatchChanger
A Python script for OBS that allows you to change sources for a 2p vs speedrun match fetching data from google sheets.

Updates a series of sources to the ones retrieved from a google spreadsheet.

Originally meant to be used for 2p vs tournaments with support for Name, Pronoum, PB and Streaming channel.

Supports hotkeys for refresh and next match.

Requires a spreadsheet that anyone with the link can see with this header:\
Match PlayerA PlayerB PronA PronB PbA PbB TwitchA TwitchB\
